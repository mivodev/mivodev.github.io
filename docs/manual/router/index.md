# Router Operations

Router operations are session-specific tasks performed once connected to a Mikrotik device. These settings vary depending on which router session you are currently in.

Once you select a session from the sidebar, you gain access to these tools:

- **[Dashboard](/manual/router/dashboard)**: Real-time traffic monitoring.
- **[Hotspot Management](/manual/router/hotspot)**: Users, Profiles, and Vouchers.
- **[Reports](/manual/router/reports)**: Sales reports and system logs.
- **[System Tools](/manual/router/tools)**: Reboot, Scheduler, and DHCP.

MIVO communicates directly with your Mikrotik API. Most changes take effect immediately on your device.
