# Dashboard & Monitoring

The Dashboard provides a real-time command center for your Mikrotik router. It aggregates critical data from the Mikrotik API to give you an immediate overview of your network's health.

MIVO features a live traffic monitor that communicates directly with your Mikrotik interfaces.
- **Interface Selection**: Choose any physical or virtual interface (e.g., `ether1`, `wlan1`, `bridge-hotspot`).
- **Live Graphing**: View incoming and outgoing traffic in bits/sec or bytes/sec.
- **Peak Tracking**: Quickly identify bandwidth spikes.

Monitor the physical health of your Mikrotik hardware:
- **CPU Load**: Displayed as a percentage. High CPU load may indicate the need for hardware upgrades or configuration optimization.
- **Memory**: Tracks free vs. total RAM.
- **Uptime**: Shows how long the router has been running since the last reboot.
- **Disk/Storage**: Monitor available space on your router's flash memory.

A quick summary of currently authenticated users:
- **Total Online**: Real-time count of users currently using the hotspot.
